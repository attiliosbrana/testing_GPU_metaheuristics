# GPU accelerated portfolio optimization
In this python notebook, two methods are tested in a simple task of optimizing a portfolio of three assets.

These two methods are:
1) Differential evolutionary; and
2) Dispersive flies optimization.

Both algorithms have been vectorized for GPU-processing in Pytorch.

The results demonstrate that both algorithms fastly converge to the global optimum as can be observed in the dynamic Plotly charts.

Dependencies:
Pytorch
Plotly
